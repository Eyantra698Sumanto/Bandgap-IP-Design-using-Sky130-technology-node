- Integrated Circuits need Linear rgulated voltage which are provided by LDO(Low-dropout linear regulators).
- These LDO's provide regulated voltage independent of temperature, supply voltage and the process.
- They have a temp. coeff. of 10-15ppm/ degree Celsius.
- PSRR=40-60dB
- Current to these circuits are provided by PVT(Process Voltage Temperature).
- Ways to gernerate ref. voltage:
  * Voltage Divider- Good Temp. Coeff.  but Sensitivity unity hence undesired
