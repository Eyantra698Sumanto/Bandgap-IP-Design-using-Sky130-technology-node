- Integrated Circuits need Linear rgulated voltage which are provided by LDO(Low-dropout linear regulators).
- These LDO's provide regulated voltage independent of temperature, supply voltage and the process.
- They have a temp. coeff. of 10-15ppm/ degree Celsius.
- PSRR=40-60dB
- Current to these circuits are provided by PVT(Process Voltage Temperature).
- Ways to gernerate ref. voltage:
  * Voltage Divider- Good Temp. Coeff.  but Sensitivity unity hence undesirable.
  * Forward biased pn junction- Better than Voltage Divider but still undersirable.
  * Base Emitter Voltage Referenced Circuit- Good Supply Rejection but temp. coef. needs to be improved.
  * Bandgap Reference- Best temp. coef and good sensitivity. Hence it is widely used.

## BGRSK1-Day1-Theory Lec1 Introduction to BGR
- Temperature, power supply and circuit changes independent voltage reference
- Produces constant voltage of 1.2V(close band energy gap of silicon)
- Why BGR?
  * Battery unsuitable as volatge drops with time
  * Power supply has ripple hnce unsuitable 
  * Zener diode is not used due to frequency and thermal noise constraints
  * A BGR can be integrated in bulk CMOS, bi CMOS without need for external components
  * Hence BGR is widely used
- Applications of BGR
  * LDO
  * DC to DC Buck  Converters
  * ADCs and DACs

## BGRSK1-Day1-Theory Lec2 CTAT Voltage generation Circuit 
### CTAT Voltage Generation
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58599984/138247274-5df9f425-209e-432e-a106-0182e4129c86.png)
- It is done in two ways:
1. Using Diode
2. Using BJT
### Why BJT is preferred na not diode
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58599984/138248192-13df5133-67c2-4701-af1f-7fa6ca39ece9.png)
- Because as shown in fig. above it is difficult to connect P-substrate of diode to ground hence BJT is preferred.
### Analysis of CTAT Circuit

- Temperature coefficient = -1.88 mV/degree Kelvin
### CTAT Voltage Generation in various cases
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58599984/138249308-7fdf5073-89a4-469c-8f93-f530ab6f1061.png)
#### Case 1: Constant current and BJT units
#### Case 2: Increasing the BJT units
#### Case 3: Increasing Current

### Characteristics of PTAT Circuit

- As temperature increases, the current through Q2 shown above increases due to higher value of N. 
- As a result the slope of V1 Vs. T is more neagtive that than of V vs. T. 
- Hence the difference V-V1 increases with T.
### Design of Resistance
- Resistance value can be calculated by the formula R1=VT ln(N)/I
- For 10uA current and N=8, R1=5.4k ohms
## BGRSK1-Day1-Theory Lec4 Biased Current Mirror Circuit
### Current Mirror

#### Objective
- Independent of Supply
- Independent of Process
- Well Defined behavior with process
#### Issues
- Output current sensitive to VDD
- Solution- The circuit must bias itself

### Self Bias current mirror

#### Objective
- The idea of Self bias is that Iout should be indepnedent of Iref
#### Issues
- Iout=K * Iref hence can support any amount of currnrt
- To define a current one more constraint to be added

- I3 same as I1 and I2
- Voltage across C3 is CTAT type
- Voltage across R2 is PTAT type

# Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Mr. Kunal Ghosh, Mrs. Anagha Ghosh, Prof. Saroj Rout and Prof. Shantanu Sarangi for the tutorial explained in the simplest way possible. It helped me to learn more about the BandGap Reference in a very easy and structured manner. Also, the labs were very well explained. It will be very helpful for students to  learn working on Sky130 technology as well.
